 *  Description:    Uses observed statistics from a public bicycle hire system
 *                  to clusters hire stations into a predefined number of random
 *                  clusters, in order to measure the total distance ridden
 *                  between the clusters based on observed rides.  The total
 *                  actual distance ridden can then be used to convert these
 *                  values to a proportion of all trips confined within the
 *                  randomly generated clusters.  The distribution of resultant
 *                  values provides the statistical values with which the actual
 *                  observed values may be compared.
 *
 *  Project Structure:  
 *      Routines are divided between the two main programs:
 *      1. mainNeutral:     Randomly allocates points to clusters to estimate
 *                          `neutral' values of distances ridden within versus
 *                          between clusters 
 *      2. mainActual:      Reads in file of actual cluster memberships
 *                          (generated in R) to determine actual values of
 *                          distances ridden within versus between clusters.
 *      These in turn use the classes ClusterData (to store data as produced from
 *      routines in bike-correlations) and Clusters (to store results of
 *      subsequent calculations). ClusterData includes:
 *      (i)     GetDirName ()
 *      (ii)    GetStations ();
 *      (iii)   MakeStationIndex ();
 *      (iv)    readDMat ();
 *      (v)     readNTrips ();
 *      ClusterCalculations includes:
 *      (i)     allocateClusters ();
 *      (ii)    readClusters ();
 *      (iii)   calcClusterDists ();
 *
 *  Limitations:
 *
 *  Dependencies:       libboost
 *
 *  Compiler Options:   -std=c++11
